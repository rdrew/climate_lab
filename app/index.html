            <p>PEI history comes to life in this third edition of PEI’s weather trivia calendar of all new 365 stories about Prince Edward Island weather and its impact on Islanders’ everyday life. This calendar brings stories from North Cape to East Point, West Point to Murray Head – and all points in-between over the past 250 years. A great gift for any Islander, and any occasion – birthdays, Christmas or even Islander Day!</p>


            <p class="pullquote">“There are so many stories in there; there are some sad ones and some funny ones. This year we have a focus on lightning and thunderstorms and on storm surges,” says Jardine who is the climate station manager at the Climate Research Lab, of which Fenech is director.</p>


            <p class="pullquote">“Because of the nature of the Island, the way that we live, we’re very affected by it; sometimes it keeps us at home or away from school and sometimes it drags us to the beaches because it’s so nice,” Fenech says. “But the weather really controls a lot of what we do and who we are. We say in our calendar ‘Our weather is our story.’ It’s the stories around the weather that are so intriguing.”</p>


            <p>Co-authored by Don Jardine and Dr. Adam Fenech and published by the Climate Research Lab at UPEI, this 3rd edition of the weather trivia calendar is filled with 365 new stories about real local weather events from across the Island over the past 250 years and their impact on Islanders’ everyday lives.</p>


            <p>everydayThere’s nothing like the weather as a conversation starter. The 2017 Prince Edward Island weather trivia calendar, Some Weather We’re Having!, will help that dialogue.</p>
